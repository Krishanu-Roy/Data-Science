What is Data
# Topic Objective: Identify applications of data in daily life.

Data is created through many modern daily activities. Organizations gather this data and apply data analytics to inform practical business applications. 
There are three main types of data: observed data, volunteered data, and inferred data. The correct data visualization can intuitively present complex data patterns and trends.  

The main factors to consider when choosing a visualization are:  

> The number of variables to be shown.  

> The number of data points, or units of information, in each variable.  

> Whether the data illustrates changes over time.  

> The need to make a comparison or correlation between different groups of data points.

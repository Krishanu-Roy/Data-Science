Module 1: 
What is Data
# Topic Objective: Identify applications of data in daily life.

Data is created through many modern daily activities. Organizations gather this data and apply data analytics to inform practical business applications. 
There are three main types of data: observed data, volunteered data, and inferred data. The correct data visualization can intuitively present complex data patterns and trends.  

The main factors to consider when choosing a visualization are:  

> The number of variables to be shown.  

> The number of data points, or units of information, in each variable.  

> Whether the data illustrates changes over time.  

> The need to make a comparison or correlation between different groups of data points.  

Data is All Around Us !

Topic objective: Compare and contrast the different types of data.

Data analysis begins with understanding the types of data. Data is either defined as quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is divided into discrete and 
continuous data. The data type tells a system how to interpret the data’s value, so the system can perform operations to transform and use the data in computations.  

Data types include:  
String , Integer , Floating point , Date and time , Boolean 

The data should be categorized as structured or unstructured before it is processed, stored, and analyzed. After data is defined and selected, 
it becomes relevant in determining the questions to be answered.  

Business Understanding 

Topic Objective: Evaluate the value gained through analytics.

Data science enables businesses to better understand the impact of their products and services, adjust their methods and goals, and provide their customers with 
better products faster. Trend analysis is one way to gain insights into key performance indicators (KPI) over time.  

Humanitarian Organizations use data to serve their communities and the world. Predictive analytics can focus humanitarian efforts on preventive 
rather than reactive actions. Environmental agencies track climate change data through observations which enable predictions of societal impact. 

REFLECTION 

The world population continues to climb. The need to feed that growing population makes the agricultural sector more dependent on data than ever before. 
Agricultural farmers utilize data to determine the right weather, soil yield, supply and demand for the type of crops. These analytics impact what to plant, when to plant,
when to harvest, and when to sell. For livestock farmers, data analytics drives breeding rates, land management, purchasing of hay and grain, and determining the sales
market. 

The farmer's role may have stayed relatively the same as the decades before us, but the approach has drastically changed due to data analytics. 
The increased need for a sustainable and consistent food supply raises new questions. Questions for reflection include:  

What percentage of land should be dedicated to farming versus communities?  

What other data should be gathered to ensure a good food source for generations while not negatively impacting the environment?  

Data analytics will continue to play a significant role in improving farming methods for future generations.
